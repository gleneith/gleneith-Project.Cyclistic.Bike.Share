## Project Cyclistic Bike-Share 

A project based on a case study, were I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, bike-share company based in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximising the annual memberships. Cyclistic consist of two forms of memberships, annual riders and annual riders. As part of the marketing analyst team, we are given the task of discovering insights and understanding how casual riders and annual riders are used and their behaviours when using Cyclists. From these insights, create a new marketing strategy in converting casual riders into annual members. Although, for the new marketing strategy to be passed down, we would need to convince the executives to approve these strategies meaning data visualisation would be used in backing up these data insights.
