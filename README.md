## Project Cyclistic Bike-Share [Project Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wEesjlmjX1O2kcJOcM8uOcGf0T4uB0NAIOWHGozxsIE/edit?usp=drive_link)

#### A project based on a case study, where I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago. The marketing director believes the company's future success depends on maximising the annual memberships. Cyclistic consists of two forms of memberships, annual riders and annual riders. As part of the marketing analyst team, we are tasked with discovering insights and understanding how casual and annual riders are used and their behaviours when using Cyclists. These insights create a new marketing strategy for converting casual riders into annual members. However, for the new marketing strategy to be passed down, we would need to convince the executives to approve these strategies meaning data visualisation would be used in backing up these data insights.
